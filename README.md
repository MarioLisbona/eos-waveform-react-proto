This desktop UI prototype is built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. The application uses the [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js) library to visuially represet an audio or video clip in a waveform display.

The user is presented with two waveforms, one that represents an overview of the entire media source and another wavform that represents a zoomed in view of a portion of the waveform. The overview window has a highlighted section that is displayed in the zoomview window. Users can visually add, edit, delete and create segments on the waveform. A list of the added clips is displayed below the waveform.

## Installation Instructions

1. Create a directory called `waveform-react-proto` and navigate into that directory.

- `$ mkdir waveform-react-proto && cd waveform-react-proto`

2. Once in the `/waveform-react-proto` directory, in the terminal run the following command:

- `$ git clone git@github.com:MarioLisbona/waveform-react-proto.git`

- Navigate to the client folder:

- `$ cd waveform-react-proto`
- Install packages using Yarn

- `yarn install`

- Run the development server with the following command:

- `yarn start`

- By default the development server will run at `localhost:3000/` however if this port is already in use another port will be provided.

- You will also be provided a link in the terminal to the port where the client server is running:

  ![server port](docs/waveform-react-proto-dev-server.png)

- Open a browser with the address pointint to `localhost:3000/`. You will now be able to view all the Waveform editor prototype.

- Use the command `ctrl+c` to kill the server.
